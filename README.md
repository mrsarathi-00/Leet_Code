Welcome to my LeetCode problem-solving repository! This is where I consistently upload solutions to LeetCode problems as part of my daily coding practice.

ðŸ“… Goal
I aim to solve **2 LeetCode problems every day** and post the solutions here. This routine helps me strengthen my problem-solving skills, stay sharp with data structures and algorithms, and prepare for technical interviews.

ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each solution is organized by:
- Problem name
- Problem number
- Date of submission
- Solution file (in Python/C++/Java).

ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Am using java program here.
- But don't worry i use chatgpt to convert the same logic into C++ / Python.
- All problems are from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- Solutions may include inline comments and brief explanations
- Some problems may include alternate approaches or optimizations

Happy coding! ðŸš€
